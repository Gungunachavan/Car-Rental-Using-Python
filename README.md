# 🚗 Car Rental System — Python (OOP-Based)

A menu-driven car rental application developed in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This project simulates a basic rental flow, managing customers, car availability, and rental transactions.

---

## 💡 Project Overview

This command-line application is built around three core Python classes — `Car`, `Customer`, and `Rental` — and demonstrates how OOP principles like encapsulation, object interactions, and state management come together to build a structured solution.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Object-Oriented Programming**  
  Encapsulation, class relationships, and state change tracking through `Car`, `Customer`, and `Rental`.

- **Structured Logic**  
  Use of conditions, loops, and list comprehensions to manage car bookings and display rental details.

- **Customer Interaction**  
  Renting and returning cars dynamically, showing real-world flow of how rentals are handled.
